### Setting Up Puppeteer with ScraperAPI

To configure Puppeteer with ScraperAPI, follow these steps:

```javascript
const apiKey = "SCRAPE9837861"; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Set up proxy through ScraperAPI
  const scraperApiUrl = `http://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=${apiKey}&url=`;
  const targetUrl = 'https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop';
  await page.goto(`${scraperApiUrl}${encodeURIComponent(targetUrl)}`);

  // Perform scraping operations
  const products = await page.evaluate(() => {
    const items = [];
    document.querySelectorAll('div[data-component-type="s-search-result"]').forEach(product => {
      const title = product.querySelector('h2 a span')?.textContent || 'N/A';
      const price = product.querySelector('.a-offscreen')?.textContent || 'N/A';
      const rating = product.querySelector('.a-icon-alt')?.textContent || 'N/A';
      const image = product.querySelector('.s-image')?.src || 'N/A';
      items.push({ title, price, rating, image });
    });
    return items;
  });

  console.log(products);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

This script connects Puppeteer to ScraperAPI, retrieves Amazon product data, and outputs it as an array of objects.
