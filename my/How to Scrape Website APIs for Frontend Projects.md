# How to Scrape Website APIs for Frontend Projects

**Are you struggling to find data for your frontend projects?** Many frontend developers, especially students, face challenges when backend support for APIs is unavailable. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through how to scrape APIs from websites to use their data effectively. This tutorial demonstrates scraping APIs from QQ Music and CSDN.

## 1. How to Find API Endpoints

When scraping dynamic website data, the first step is identifying the API endpoint the site uses for its requests. Follow these steps to find the API address:

1. Navigate to the webpage containing the desired data. For example, if you want to scrape recommended articles from CSDN's homepage, open the homepage in your browser.
2. Open the browser's developer tools and switch to the **Network** tab. Filter by **XHR** requests (these represent `XMLHttpRequest`, which powers most AJAX calls).

3. Check the responses of various requests to locate the data you need.

4. Viewing JSON data directly in the browser can be challenging. Install a JSON viewer plugin like **JSON Viewer** for Chrome to make it easier.

5. After identifying the desired data, revisit the developer console to find the request's API endpoint and parameters.

### Analyzing Request Parameters
Experiment with removing request parameters to determine their necessity. For example, in CSDN's API for recommended articles, the parameter `category=home` specifies the homepage data, while `shown_offset` defaults to `0`. Removing unnecessary parameters can simplify your request.

## 2. Using API Endpoints

Once youâ€™ve located the API endpoint, you can fetch the data in JavaScript using AJAX or Fetch APIs. For instance, the API URL for CSDNâ€™s homepage articles is:

```
https://www.csdn.net/api/articles?type=more&category=home&shown_offset=1593997422542608
```

When making such requests, you might encounter **CORS issues**. The solution? Use a backend proxy server to bypass these restrictions.

## 3. Handling Cross-Origin Issues in Vue Projects

Hereâ€™s how to configure a backend proxy in Vue projects to resolve CORS and bypass host and referer validation:

1. **Edit the Webpack Configuration**  
   Install `express` and `axios`, then modify the `webpack.dev.conf.js` file as follows:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const axios = require('axios');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/api/apiData', async (req, res) => {
       try {
           const response = await axios.get('API_URL_HERE');
           res.json(response.data);
       } catch (error) {
           res.status(500).send(error.message);
       }
   });
   module.exports = app;
   ```

2. **Fetch Proxy Data**  
   In your Vue app (running on `localhost:8080`), you can now request the proxy URL:
   ```javascript
   axios.get('http://localhost:8080/api/apiData')
        .then(response => {
            console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error(error);
        });
   ```

### Bypassing Host and Referer Validation

Some websites validate your request headers to ensure the request originates from their domain. You can spoof these headers using a backend proxy. Update the `webpack.dev.conf.js` file to include:

```javascript
headers: {
    origin: 'https://target-website.com',
    referer: 'https://target-website.com'
}
```

Check headers in the network tab to confirm the correct `origin` and `referer` values:

## Conclusion

Mastering API scraping is an invaluable skill for frontend developers, particularly when backend support is unavailable. Using tools like developer consoles, JSON viewers, and proxy servers, you can easily scrape and use web data in your projects.
