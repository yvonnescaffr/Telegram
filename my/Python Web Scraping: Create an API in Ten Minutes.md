# Python Web Scraping: Create an API in Ten Minutes

Web scraping often begins with a question: **Does the target website provide an API?** If yes, great! But what if the website doesn‚Äôt have an API, and you still want to scrape data efficiently? Here‚Äôs where creativity comes into play: if there‚Äôs no API, you can build one.

## Transforming Scraped Data into APIs

Many data-related tasks follow this basic flow: **scrape data ‚Üí store data ‚Üí create an API ‚Üí update data regularly**. However, you‚Äôre likely not looking to master API service deployment‚Äîyou just want to use the website‚Äôs data.

Enter **Toapi**. This tool automates the process, allowing you to **access real-time data from websites** effortlessly.

### Example: Toapi in Action

Here‚Äôs an example website (no API provided) that can be transformed using Toapi: [Chengdu Government Info](http://gk.chengdu.gov.cn/govInfoPub/list.action?classId=07170201020202&tn=2&p=1). The magic of Toapi makes the website data as easy to consume as a slice of cake.

## How to Build an API with Toapi

With just **10 lines of code**, you can create a data API. Let‚Äôs walk through an example:

```python
from toapi import XPath, Item, Api
from toapi import Settings

# Custom settings for the API
class MySettings(Settings):
    web = {
        "with_ajax": False  # Disable PhantomJS for AJAX loading
    }

# Define the target website for scraping
api = Api('http://gk.chengdu.gov.cn/govInfoPub/', settings=MySettings)

# Define the structure for scraped data
class Post(Item):
    url = XPath('/html/body/div[2]/div/div[3]//a/@href')
    title = XPath('/html/body/div[2]/div/div[3]//a/span[2]/text()')
    
    class Meta:
        source = XPath('/html')  # Part of the HTML containing the data
        route = {"/test?page=:page": "list.action?classId=07170201020202&tn=2&p=:page"}

# Register the scraping service
api.register(Post)

# Run the server
api.serve()

# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

With this code, you can create an API that retrieves data from the website. It‚Äôs simple, efficient, and only takes a few minutes to set up.

### Understanding the Code

1. **Custom Settings**: Configure how Toapi interacts with the website (e.g., whether AJAX is needed).
2. **Item Definition**: Map the data you want to scrape using XPath.
3. **API Registration**: Register your scraping logic with Toapi‚Äôs API framework.
4. **Run the Server**: The server is ready to serve JSON-formatted data!
