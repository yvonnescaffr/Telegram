## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites automatically. The extracted data can be saved in a local file or database, enabling users to collect, organize, and analyze large amounts of online information efficiently.

### How Web Scraping Works
1. **Sending a Request**: A program or tool, called a "scraper," sends a GET request to a website.
2. **Receiving a Response**: The website responds with an HTML document.
3. **Parsing Data**: The scraper processes the HTML document, searches for the required data, and converts it into a usable format like JSON or CSV.

There are two primary methods to perform web scraping:
- **Using HTTP or Web Browsers**: Collect data through standard web browsers.
- **Using Bots or Web Crawlers**: Automate the process with bots that crawl the web.

While scraping can be perceived as intrusive, it is often legal and ethical when data is publicly available or explicitly shared via APIs.

- **Market Research**: Analyze competitorsâ€™ pricing, promotions, and product offerings.
- **SEO Optimization**: Monitor keyword rankings and competitor strategies.
- **E-commerce**: Aggregate product details, prices, and customer reviews.
- **Data Journalism**: Collect information for reporting and analysis.
